## Prompt

/sp.constitution

Project: Evolution of Todo

Purpose:
This constitution defines the mandatory global rules, constraints, and quality
standards for completing the 5-Phase "Evolution of Todo" project using
Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

It applies to ALL phases, features, specifications, plans, tasks, implementations,
and deployments.

────────────────────────────────────
CORE REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
────────────────────────────────────
- All development must be Spec-Driven
- Every phase and feature MUST have:
  - A Markdown Constitution (this file)
  - A Markdown Specification
- All code must be generated by Claude Code
- Manual code writing is strictly forbidden
- Specs must be refined until correct output is generated

────────────────────────────────────
MANDATORY WORKFLOW (ALL PHASES)
────────────────────────────────────
Every feature in every phase MUST follow:

/sp.constitution → /sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.task → /sp.implement

Rules:
- No step may be skipped
- Implementation must not exceed the approved spec
- Specs are the single source of truth

────────────────────────────────────
PHASE OBLIGATIONS
────────────────────────────────────
- Phase I–V must ALL be implemented
- Each phase must build cleanly on the previous phase
- No breaking changes to earlier phase functionality

Special Requirements:
- Phases III, IV, V:
  - Integrated conversational AI chatbot
  - Natural language Todo management
  - Use OpenAI Chatkit
  - Use OpenAI Agents SDK
  - Use Official MCP SDK

- Phases IV, V:
  - Local deployment on Minikube
  - Cloud deployment on DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS)

────────────────────────────────────
ENGINEERING & AI STANDARDS
────────────────────────────────────
- Clean, modular, and extensible architecture
- Explicit state management and data flow
- Agent behavior must be deterministic and auditable
- Natural language commands must map reliably to Todo actions

────────────────────────────────────
DELIVERABLE RULES
────────────────────────────────────
- Working implementation per phase is mandatory
- Markdown documentation required for:
  - Specs
  - Architecture decisions
  - Setup and execution
- Demo evidence must reflect spec-compliant behavior

────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY GATES
────────────────────────────────────
A phase is considered complete only if:
- All features in the phase spec are implemented
- Code is fully generated by Claude Code
- No manual code edits exist
- System behaves exactly as specified

────────────────────────────────────
SUCCESS CRITERIA
────────────────────────────────────
- All 5 phases implemented end-to-end
- AI chatbot successfully manages Todos via natural language
- Application runs locally and on Kubernetes (as required)
- Project demonstrates clear evolution from CLI to AI-native system

This constitution is binding.
Acknowledge compliance before issuing any /sp.specify.

## Response snapshot

# Evolution of Todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
All development must be Spec-Driven; Every phase and feature MUST have a Markdown Constitution and Specification; All code must be generated by Claude Code; Manual code writing is strictly forbidden; Specs must be refined until correct output is generated

### Mandatory Workflow Compliance
Every feature in every phase MUST follow: /sp.constitution → /sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.task → /sp.implement; No step may be skipped; Implementation must not exceed the approved spec; Specs are the single source of truth

### Phase Evolution Requirements
Phase I–V must ALL be implemented; Each phase must build cleanly on the previous phase; No breaking changes to earlier phase functionality; Phases III, IV, V require integrated conversational AI chatbot and natural language Todo management; Phases IV, V require local and cloud deployment

### Engineering & AI Standards
Clean, modular, and extensible architecture; Explicit state management and data flow; Agent behavior must be deterministic and auditable; Natural language commands must map reliably to Todo actions

### Deliverable Quality Gates
Working implementation per phase is mandatory; Markdown documentation required for specs, architecture decisions, setup and execution; Demo evidence must reflect spec-compliant behavior

### Quality Assurance
A phase is considered complete only if all features in the phase spec are implemented, code is fully generated by Claude Code, no manual code edits exist, and system behaves exactly as specified

## Technology Requirements
Use OpenAI Chatkit, OpenAI Agents SDK, and Official MCP SDK for Phases III-V; Local deployment on Minikube for Phases IV-V; Cloud deployment on DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) for Phases IV-V

## Success Criteria
All 5 phases implemented end-to-end; AI chatbot successfully manages Todos via natural language; Application runs locally and on Kubernetes (as required); Project demonstrates clear evolution from CLI to AI-native system

## Governance
This constitution is binding and applies to ALL phases, features, specifications, plans, tasks, implementations, and deployments; All development follows the mandatory workflow; Compliance with all core requirements is non-negotiable

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-04 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-04

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created project constitution for Evolution of Todo with all required principles and guidelines
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to create feature specification
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution properly implements all requirements from user input with appropriate principles for spec-driven development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all requirements met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with /sp.specify to create feature specification
